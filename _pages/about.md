Hello! Witam! 

My name is Ola Zalecki and welcome to my portfolio page.

I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College where I earned my Bachelor's of Arts in Geography with a minor in Spanish. As an undergraduate student I gravitated towards learning about people, societies and their systems. how these relationships were visible in space and the effects of these relationships on the environment. My research interests are also heavily influenced by my upbringing on Chicago's Northwest side. This means that I am passionate about public spaces, immigrant place-making, and, of course, hot dog stands. Visualizing my research in a way that is accessible, comprehendible and engaging is what I strive to do both as a researcher and cartographer. 

Currently, I am the Assistant in Science Instruction for the Department of Geography at Middlebury College. 

When Iâ€™m not at work hunched over my computer screen, you're most likely to find me baking a sweet treat or hanging out near a body of water.
