Hello! Witam! 

I’m Ola and I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College with a degree in Geography and a minor in Spanish. I am beginning my career as the Assistant in Instruction with Middlebury’s Department of Geography. 

My upbringing on Chicago’s Northwest side has definitely shaped my interests in my research. I am passionate about public spaces, promoting people oriented urban planning, and hot dog stands. Visualizing these themes in a way that is accessible, comprehendible and engaging is what I strive to do as a cartographer. I find a lot of joy in working with people and I naturally seek out hands-on projects where I am given the space to think creatively and critically. 

When I’m not hunched over my computer, you can probably find me baking a sweet treat or reading near some kind of body of water.
