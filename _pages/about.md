Hello! Witam! 

I am the Assistant in Instruction for the Middlebury College Geography Department. 

My upbringing on Chicago's northwest side have signficiantly shaped my interests within the field of Geography. I am passionate about public spaces, place-making, and promoting people oriented urban planning.
