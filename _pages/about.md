Hello! Witam! 

My name is Ola Zalecki and welcome to my portfolio page.

I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College where I earned my Bachelor's of Arts in Geography with a minor in Spanish. 

I have always gravitated towards learning about people, societies and their systems 

I've always gravitates towards learning about people, societes and the environment long before I discovered the discipline of geography. As an undergraduate student I learned both the tools and language in order to delve deep into the relationship between people and their environment and how all of these elements are visible across space. My research interests are heavily influenced by my upbringing on Chicago's Northwest side which means that I'm passionate about public spaces, immigrant place-making, and, of course, hot dog stands. Visualizing my research through maps in a way that is accessible, comprehendible and engaging is what I strive to do both as a researcher and cartographer. 

Currently, I am the Assistant in Science Instruction for the Department of Geography at Middlebury College where I support courses in GIS and Cartography. 

When Iâ€™m not at work hunched over my computer screen, you're most likely to find me baking a sweet treat or hanging out near a body of water.
