Hello! Witam! 

I’m Ola and I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College with a degree in Geography and a minor in Spanish. I am beginning my career as the Assistant in Instruction with Middlebury’s Department of Geography. 

My research interests heavily pull from my upbringing on Chicago's Northwest side. I am passionate about public spaces, promoting people oriented urban planning, and hot dog stands. At the moment I'm focusing on geographical and GIS pedagogy as the Assistant in Science Instruction with Middlebury's Department of Geography Visualizing these themes in a way that is accessible, comprehendible and engaging is what I strive to do as a cartographer. I find a lot of joy in working with people and I naturally seek out hands-on projects where I am given the space to think creatively and critically. 

When I’m not hunched over my computer screen, you can probably find me baking a sweet treat or hanging out near a body of water.
