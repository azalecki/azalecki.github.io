Hello! Witam! 

My name is Ola Zalecki and welcome to my portfolio page. I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College with a degree in Geography and a minor in Spanish. Believe it or not, I have decided to stay in Middlebury to be the Assistant in Instruction for the Department of Geography.

My research interests are heavily influenced by my upbringing on Chicago's Northwest side which means that I am passionate about public spaces, promoting people oriented urban planning, and hot dog stands. Visualizing my research topics in a way that is accessible, comprehendible and engaging is what I strive to do both as a researcher and cartographer. On principle, I find a lot of joy in working with people and I naturally seek out hands-on projects where I am given the space to think creatively and critically. 

When Iâ€™m not hunched over my computer screen, you're most likely to find me baking a sweet treat or hanging out near a body of water.
