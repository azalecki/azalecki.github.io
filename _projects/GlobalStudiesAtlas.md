When I was hired as a research assistant my sophomore year as an undergraduate student, the Global Studies Atlas was only a Google Drive of ideas. Before I would have the pleasure of finally holding the completed work in my hands this summer, it would take 3 years, 3 faculty writers and __ cartographic assistants to get the atlas to print. I'm still afraid to look at any of the maps closely in case I find a mistake that would be too late to fix at this point. 

I look back on my involvement with the Global Studies Atlas fondly. The nature of the work to churn out over 50 maps was meticulous and sometimes felt sisyphean. However, I cherished how colloborative it was. 

Although every map in the atlas has undergone collabortive revision there are a handful of maps that I feel are uniquely "mine." Fortunately, us research assistants were given some creative liberty.

The historical maps were the final hurdle.
