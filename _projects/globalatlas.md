The [Middlebury Atlas of Globalization](https://www.langenscheidt.com/shop/englisch/middlebury-atlas-of-globalization-SW50013?srsltid=AfmBOoqcND4qE6kT0WviLjYcHgRB_k4lP0jtJYCV7HFWz9MuA521LBOc) is an atlas textbook for college level introductory courses in international and global studies. The atlas was authored by three Middlebury College professors and explores the process of globalization through various academic disciplines like history, political science and environmental studies. The atlas includes over 100 maps, atleast 50 of which I had the pleasure of helping produce. 

The atlas was finally published at the start of the Fall semester in 2024. I joined the global atlas team two years prior as a sophomore student. As a research assistant I explored topics such as military spending, flows of capital, religious affiliation and tracked down available data. I then wrangled it into a format that could be used with GIS software and mapped it using a template that my team and I had created ing QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. Although my team was limited by the template, we were still entrusted with making certain carographic decisions. Particularly when considering how to represent disputed borders and/or improving accessibility for those with color vision deficiencies. 

As the project progressed and the team grew, my role as a research assistant shifted. With almost 7 people on the team and at least 50 maps in varying stages of completion, I took on a project management role overseeing progress, editing and delegating tasks.
