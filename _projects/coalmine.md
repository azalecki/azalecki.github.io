The map titled "Coal Mine Next Door" was created during a cartographic design seminar in my final year as an undergraduate student. This map is about the extent and "closeness" of surface mining as much as it's prevelance. With Kanawha County, WV as my subject I attempt to mountain top removal into perspective. This is a map about a story with multiple characters: mountain top removal, populated valleylands, and the flowing water bodies that link them.
