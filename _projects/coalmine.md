The map titled "Coal Mine Next Door" was created during a cartographic design seminar in my final year as an undergraduate student. This map is about the extent and "closeness" of surface mining as much as it's prevelance. With Kanawha County, WV as my subject I attempt to mountain top removal into perspective. This is a map about a story with multiple characters: mountain top removal, populated valleylands, and the flowing water bodies that link them. 

On this page, I will walk you through the process of my first independent and long-duration mapping project with a focus on my design decisions.

My initial vision for this project was to map flooding exarcebated by strip mining in the populated valley lands of Kanawha County. In spite of my tedious efforts to sketch drafts and search for data, I decided that this grand idea of mapping flood data was too much for one semester. However, I was still captivated by the flow of water and the water bodies that pervade the landscape. Because the Kanawha River in my mind plays a central role in this narrative, I needed to make it a central figure on the map. To do this I abondoned the typical north-south orientation to have the river flow down the center of my map. 


The color scheme for this map is meant to hearken to the past. When looking for inspiration I kept coming back to the look and textures of old US coal mining maps. I tried to emulate this with the aged parchment-like base color. This was also the part in the process where I was extensively researching the history of strip mining and the cultures and traditions of the region. For my color scheme I also heavily took inspiration from Appalachian quilting traditions, the patterns of which embody local histories and cultural heritage.
